# Example 2: basic_syntax

## Example Description
This example will walk you through the basic syntax of .tex files and a **very
very** basic overview of LaTeX syntax.

Since we can treat TeX as essentially a computer language that gets *compiled*
into a pdf document, we can make our own Hello World example.

### File Structure
```
├── basic_syntax.tex        -- the main TeX file
├── output                  -- output directory
│   ├── basic_syntax.aux    -- an intermediate file that is generated before the pdf is complete
│   ├── basic_syntax.log    -- compilation log
│   ├── basic_syntax.pdf    -- the final output pdf file
│   └── basic_syntax.toc    -- an intermediate table of contents file
└── README.md               -- you are here

```
